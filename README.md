# Refactoring Code 

# Refactor the existing code so that it is not only re-organized and structured but meets accessibility standards as well 

# Issues with the existing code/website 

      None of images in the existing code had alt attibute tags. The importance of alt attribute tags falls back on the criteria meeting a particular set of standards concerning 
      web assessibility for people with disabilities. The alt tag text of the image should be described in a manner that will emphasize the main objective of the image in the event the user is utilizing a screen reader application. 
      
      Further consideration should be taken such as using proper text abbreviations so that screen reader applications are able to read the text. For example, abbreviations should have periods between the letters, otherwise the screen reader won't recognize the text.

      The website title for the existing code was "website". For a business that is striving to generate leads and increase their search engine optimization, having a generic title can affect the optimization of search engine requests. The website title should ALWAYS signify the objective of the content product/service being offered.

      The semantics of the HTML document were non-existent. Looking at code can be daunting, having semantics within the code itself can restructre/organize for the viewer. 

      The existing code had no comments indicating what the code represents nor what the developers attempt with the code was. 

      The search engine link wasn't functioning properly. This shows a poor review of the syntax. Developers should always test the code prior to executing it. 

      CSS syntax was disorganized and multiple elements using the same styling attributes were listed seperately 

# Changes made to the existing code 

    Alt attribute tags were added to all images 

    Title website was changed from website to "Search Engine Strategies" given that the company themselves are striving to assist their own clients with S.E.O, lead generations and social media marketing. 

    Basic semantic tags were added to the existing code to structure more efficiently. The tags added were a header, sections, and a footer. 

    Comments were made throughtout the HTML document 

    Combined the elements within CSS to organize the styling sheet 

    After creating semantics in the HTML document, other changes were needed which resulted from the tags being added. Made various changes to increase/decrease padding/margins, text-size, images, etc. 

    The link to the S.E.O needed to have a class attached to it rather than an ID 

    I toggle word wrapped the paragraphs so that the content was more visible and structured
